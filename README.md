Call Center Performance Dashboard
Overview
This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to analyze and optimize call center performance using Power BI. The dataset contains key metrics that help monitor customer service efficiency, call answer times, issue resolution rates, and overall customer satisfaction.

Project Objectives
Analyze call center performance: Measure key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average call answer times, resolution times, and customer satisfaction scores.
Identify improvement areas: Highlight potential areas for optimizing call center operations.
Visualize trends: Provide insights into call volume trends, agent performance, and customer satisfaction over time.
Key Features
Call Answer Time Analysis: Track the average time taken to answer customer calls.
Issue Resolution Metrics: Measure how quickly customer issues are resolved.
Customer Satisfaction Scores: Monitor feedback from customers on their experience with the call center.
Agent Performance: Compare the performance of different agents based on key metrics.
Time-based Analysis: Identify peak call times and workload distribution.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used to create an interactive dashboard with various visualizations.
Dataset: A dataset containing 51,000 entries related to call center activity.
